## Requirements
On all platforms the Java Runtime Environment is required to run the TUI Sweeper.  
The lowest required version of JRE is **1.8**.  
The game was tested on all JRE versions from `1.8` to `17` inclusive.  
The game was **not** tested on a headless JRE

## Windows
To play TUI Sweeper on Windows it is recommended to download the executable file (.exe) from the [Releases page]().  
Alternatively you can download the universal JAR file.

## Linux
### (Recommended) Install from Debian repository
You can download the game from my Debian repository.
To do so:

1. Add the repository to your system
```shell

```

2. Install TUI Sweeper using APT
```shell
sudo apt-get install tui-sweeper
```

### Manual installation
To install TUI Sweeper without adding any repositories you can download the Debian package (or universal JAR if you don't want to install/don't have root privileges) from the [Releases page]().

## Other
TUI Sweeper should be able to run on any platform that can run Java applications.  
It was confirmed to run in Termux on Android.
